# HorribleSubsTorrentDownloader

Precompiled: https://www.mediafire.com/?hiw35kzb6ztopjj

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the program once

2. A folder in your C: will be created named "HSTorrentDownloader"

3. Place PhantomJS into that folder

4. Rerun the program and a firewall prompt will appear asking for permission for PhantomJS

5. You must allow it for it to work

I suggest tracking an anime from episode 2 onwards as horriblesubs sometimes creates multiple names for episode 1 ex: 1v1 1v2 which this program cant distinguish as of yet.

To make changes to your anime list or to add a new anime simple edit the list.txt file located in: C:\HSTorrentDownloader or delete it and restart the program

Format is: title episode

If you wish to manually add a new anime the spaces must be replaced by dashes ex: shingeki-no-kyojin 1

To terminate the program when it is not visible (Program hides itself when its tracking for new episodes as of now it checks every hour) (Open taskmanager and find Horriblesubsdownloader and click end task)
