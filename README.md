# HorribleSubsTorrentDownloader

Precompiled: https://www.mediafire.com/?hiw35kzb6ztopjj

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the program once

2. A folder in your C: will be created named "HSTorrentDownloader"

3. Place PhantomJS into that folder

4. Rerun the program and a firewall prompt will appear asking for permission for PhantomJS

5. You must allow it for it to work..

I suggest tracking an anime from episode 2 onwards as horriblesubs sometimes creates multiple names for episode 1 ex: 1v1 1v2 which this program cant distinguish as of yet.

To make changes to your anime list or to add a new anime simple edit the list.txt file located in: C:\HSTorrentDownloader

Format is: title episode

If you wish to manually add a new anime the spaces must be replaced by dashes ex: shingeki-no-kyojin 1

Terminate the program and re-run it (Open taskmanager and find Horriblesubsdownloader and end task)
